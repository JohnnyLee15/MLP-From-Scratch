# MLP Neural Network in C++ ü§ñ

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network written in C++. It includes support for training with stochastic gradient descent, learning rate decay, batching, and flexible layer definitions.

## Features ‚ú®

- Customizable number of layers and neurons
- ReLU and Softmax activation functions
- Forward and backward propagation
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer
- Learning rate decay
- Batching support for efficient training
- Basic data loading utility

## Requirements üß∞

- C++11 or later
- OpenMP (for parallelization)
- Standard C++ libraries (no external dependencies)

## Installing OpenMP üß©

If you're compiling with g++, OpenMP is typically included. To install it manually:

- On **macOS**:
  - Make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.
  - Then run:
    ```bash
    brew install libomp
    ```

- On **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install libomp-dev
   ```

- On **Windows**:
  - I recommend using **MinGW-w64**, which includes `g++` with OpenMP support.
  - You can install it via [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or the standalone installer.
  - If you're using **MSVC** (Microsoft Visual Studio), make sure to enable OpenMP by adding the `/openmp` flag in your project settings (Visual Studio IDE) or in the command line if you're using `cl.exe`.


## Data Format üìÇ

- The program expects CSV files with numerical data.
- One of the columns should be the target label (you can specify which via `targetIdx`).

## How to Run üöÄ

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohnnyLee15/MLPNeuralNetProject.git
   cd MLPNeuralNetProject
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   If you have `make` installed, you can compile the program using:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This uses OpenMP flags internally via the Makefile.

3. Run the program:

   Once compiled, you can run the MLP neural network:

   ```bash
   ./mlp
   ```

4. Clean the build:

   To remove the object files and compiled binary:

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Customization üõ†Ô∏è

   You can modify the number of layers, neurons, learning rate, epochs, and batch size in the source code (`Main.cpp`).
